# alfresco_sample_server_side_scripts

I added some sample Alfresco server-side java script code that can be used as folder rules.
The scripts can be used to :
1. convert office documents to PDF
2. move documents from a regular site to the Records Management (RM) site into a folder plan auto-creating folders
3. to move documents from a WIP work-in-progress folder to a Published folder auto-creating folders
etc.
